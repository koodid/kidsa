                    Son and I are playing catch. I have a terrible throw that sails over his head. I say,
                    “Sorry, that was a bad throw.” He stops, gives me a kind look and says, “No daddy, that was a
                    wonderful throw.” Then takes 2 steps towards getting the ball. He stops again, turns back around
                    and says, “When we say something nice, even when we don’t mean it at all, that’s called being
                    polite, right?” </p>

                    I try to make it a point to take about 10 min at the end of each evening to
                    help my daughter straighten up her room. After a particularly rough day, I sat down on the floor
                    of her room to help her sort thru her dolls and I had muttered “I really don’t have the juice for
                    this tonight…”. My daughter left the room and returned a few minutes later with a cup of apple
                    juice for me.</p>
